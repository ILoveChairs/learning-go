# GO Learning Projects

Made to learn!

## Objective

Learn! (wasn't it clear?)

## How

Like every language I learn, I try to divide it into basics and then API
projects.

## Why GO

I had GO in the radar as it was supposedly a popular language for APIs and a
fast, similar to c, language. However I gave it a shot as I saw it being asked
a lot in job opportunities.

## What I learned

### Modules

go.mod should be inside the project folder.
